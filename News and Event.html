Co- Curricular  and Extra Curricular Activities-

 The students are considered as active partners in managing the Institute in its activities viz. conferences, training programmes, guest lectures, seminars and cultural programmes. It is ensured that they play an active role rather than remain passive recipients. The students are thus provided an opportunity to demonstrate their skills developed during their academic years learning , in initiating and organizing different co-curricular and extracurricular activities with the basic support from the Institute. This culture inculcates the spirit of independence and leadership in the students.  The students get involved in these activities not merely for the learning value but also for the pleasure that comes with the experience of a job well done. The students recognize their talents and skills in the process and get inspiration to develop themselves further.

We further strongly believe in all round development of students. In order to facilitate this, there are a number of student committees and clubs at the institute. These entities are comprised of and run by students themselves. Faculty guides are assigned to each club and committee with an objective to channelize and explore the hidden potential among the students. The activities carried out by these groups help the students in getting an experience of working in teams, organizing various types of events, and developing insight into multiple functions of management. The Institute actively supports sports, cultural, literary and other recreational activities.
